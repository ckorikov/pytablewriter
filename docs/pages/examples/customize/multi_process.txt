You can increase the number of workers to process table data via ``max_workers`` attribute of a writer.
The more ``max_workers`` the less processing time when tabular data is large and the execution environment has available cores.

if you increase ``max_workers`` larger than one, recommend to use main guarded as follows to avoid problemes caused by multi processing:

.. code-block:: python

    from multiprocessing import cpu_count
    import pytablewriter as ptw

    def main():
        writer = ptw.MarkdownTableWriter()
        writer.max_workers = cpu_count()
        ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
